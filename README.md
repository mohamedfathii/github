# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm start`

This script runs the app in the development mode. It will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, allowing you to view the app. The page will automatically reload if you make any edits to the code. Additionally, any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

This script launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. It will run all the tests in your project and provide you with real-time feedback. You can use this script to continuously monitor your tests while making changes to your code.

### `npm run build`

This script builds the app for production. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The resulting build files will be located in the `build` folder. The files will be minified and their filenames will include hashes. This script prepares your app for deployment.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back!**

This script allows you to eject from the build tool and have full control over the configuration files and dependencies of your project. It copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you the ability to customize them. After ejecting, you are on your own and responsible for maintaining and configuring your project.

You don't have to use `eject` if you don't need to customize the configuration. The default configuration provided by Create React App is suitable for most small and middle deployments. However, if you feel the need to customize the build tool, you can use this script to gain full control.

To learn more about Create React App, you can refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started). This documentation provides detailed information on how to use Create React App to bootstrap your React projects.

To learn more about React itself, you can check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/). This documentation covers all aspects of React, including its core concepts, components, and advanced topics.

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
